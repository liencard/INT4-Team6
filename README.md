# INT4-Team6

## Project
Our challenge was to find a way to offer a travel experience in a post-corona era, without needing to travel far.
This had to be done in an unordinary, unique way that would be unforgettable for the user.

While researching the topic of traveling, we found that people explore the world to discover themselves and get to know who they are more in-depth.
Continuing further with that insight, we explored the idea to create a platform where someone can discover themselves through their ancestors.
With this in mind we created AVOS, a fictional platform where you can learn about  your ancestors through your family tree and DNA roots.

### View Website
https://int4-roots.herokuapp.com/ </br>
You are welcome to try out our demo. Note that this is a prototype created within a short timeframe.
Not every page has been developed. The family tree has been portrayed for one fictive user. 

You can view the detailpage of the following ancestors:
Margaret Evans, Maary Wallcott & Benjamin Cole

The site was made with React. Additional libraries have been used to create the different dashboard views. 
WebGL, more specifically Three.js was used to incorporate the family tree in an interactive 3D environment.
Mapbox was used to display the ancestors on the map and to create the different geographical regions. 


## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
